## Flappy Bird Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java and JFrame.

## Introduction
Flappy Bird is a popular game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between
columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game is endless, and the player's score is based
on the number of pipes successfully passed.

This project aims to recreate the gameplay experience of Flappy Bird using Java and JFrame.

## Features
Simple and intuitive controls.
Random generation of pipes for endless gameplay.
Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
Game over screen with the option to restart.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

## Usage
Run the Main.java file to start the game.
Use the spacebar or mouse click to control the bird's altitude.
Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
Avoid collisions with the pipes.
Keep track of your score as you progress through the game.
If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends. You can restart by clicking the space key.
